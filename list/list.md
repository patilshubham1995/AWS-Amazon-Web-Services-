# what is list :
#### A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable and allows duplicate members. we can add different data types like string,tuple,set,dictionary.
# For eg:-
 ### For the loop has the range between 0 to length of the given list. The value of a[i] for the current i is multiped by the multiplication of previous two digits.

if value of i=0 then a[0]=1 and s=1 hence b=1*1=1, s=b=1.

In the next step i=1 then a[1]=2 and s=1 hence b=2*1=2, s=2 and so on...
